# Overview #
This repository is a Fintech Finder Application where user can choose who to contract a work to then calculate their wages by multiplying their hourly rate with the number of hours they use to work. Then send the transaction over to the Bitcoin platform (ganache in this instance) and verify the transaction in the platform. This application uses streamlit for it's UI. 

Below are the two transactions sent over to ganache from the platform in screenshot:
